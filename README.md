# Linkin-User-Card-grid
I have created a new React application using command create-react-app.
I have created a new React application using command -> npx create-react-app my-app.
Once the application is created, navigated to the project directory by running the following command -> cd my-app.
Created a new file named Navbar.js inside Component folder in src folder. Added the code to create a navbar with a brand name and a "Get Users" button.
Created a new file named UserCard.js inside the  Component folder  in src folder. Add the following code to create a user card.
In the App.js file, I added the following code to fetch the user data and display it in a user card grid layout.
Code inside (App.js) uses the useState hook to manage the state of the user data and loading status. It also defines a function named "getUsers" that fetches the user data from the API when the "Get Users" button is clicked.
Did Styling in the required components in order to seem organized. Finally ran the application by running the command -> npm start.
It took me a day to complete this assigment.
